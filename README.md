# Quail Kingdom Market Website

## Overview
The Quail Kingdom Market Website is designed for members of **The Brass Key Collective** D&D group. It streamlines the process of purchasing magic items using the downtime purchasing rules from *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*. The website features custom-built item tables and a **Black Market** section for homebrew items tailored to individual Dungeon Master's (DM) campaigns.

## Features
- **Magic Item Purchasing**: Easily browse and purchase magic items with organized tables based on item rarity and pricing. Supports inputting rolled values with dice, or rolling within the site.
- **Black Market**: Includes homebrew items with tentative prices (displayed in *grey*), allowing DMs to adjust costs to suit their campaign.
- **Print-Friendly Option**: Use the **"Print Items"** button to generate a print-friendly item list with a space for DM authorization signatures, ensuring legitimate purchases and character auditing.

## Item Rarity & Pricing
- Item tables are organized by rarity, but players should verify pricing accuracy.
- Report any discrepancies in item rarity to a Brass Key Collective organizer for correction.
